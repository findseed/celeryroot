lousy scattershot knockoff hooked up to a lousier celeste physics sim thingie. idk. blatantly ripped from the [original scattershot video](https://youtu.be/S3WSNznLPwc) and some [cringe minecraft abominations](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2myD5YptSjvRsE7e_Z3QKxAiaKbNx7jF)<br/>

not meant to be a serious tas thing!!! just a funny lil project to see what it could do, and a sneaky excuse to learn how to code/tas celeste(debatably successful)<br/><br/>

it's not a /complete/ copy paste of celeste's code like the actual celery, but can do:<br/>
-normal, climbing, dashing, and swim states<br/>
-normal keyboard input(no joysticks)<br/>
-solid tile, spikes, spinners, jumpthru and water collision<br/>
-1 single room, loaded from a map bin and a starting condition(just extracted from my custom info atm lol)<br/><br/>

only things on my list for the future rn are(once not burnt out):<br/>
-maybe moving solids<br/>
-maybe grabby things<br/>
-idk refills/springs/whatever<br/>
-def some different things for how it explores<br/><br/>

if you wanna mess with the ?????, celery/config/Config.java has most of the fun stuff. i also left some tests for the first room of forsaken city in the demo folder that (hopefully) just work...<br/>
it doesn't do a particularly good job, but it eventually figures something out just by chance. + if you dont wanna wait for it i left their best solutions for me already in the demo/out folders<br/>
(console load 1 , 89 whatever excluded, plus you might want "auto remove mutually exclusive actions" off if celeste studio cuz it likes pressing dash/crouchdash at the same time :zany)<br/><br/>

:>€<,!¥?=]^&)^]*£€!?.."$:-!,&/$(;---=-=<br/><br/>

TBH i think celeste movement is kinda too nonlinear/precise, and tasers too cool and talented(smh) for it to do anything particularly crazy<br/>
i just think it's cool you can get any level of coherence out of just randomly pressing buttons, and not sure I'd want anything more from it anyway<br/>

there are still some things i want to try out tho ig, and this is def wayyyy faster than the original, so maybe there's something else there, idk.<br/>
i did use a boneless version in [my glider thing](https://github.com/findseed/xX_J3LL0_Xx) too which does okay, so maybe there's some scenarios where it's cooler (idk flying/swimming could be silly?), but oh well.<br/>
who cares. may god be with you and your days be bright. pet an animal. enjoy the dark and relish the love
